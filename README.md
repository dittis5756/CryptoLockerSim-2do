# Usage

1: Open and edit `c2_server = "http://c2-server-ip:5000"` in `Variables.py` file to what your C2 server ip is.

2: Navigate to `C2` directory and install dependencies on the C2 server.
```
pip install -r C2_requirements.txt
```

3: Run the C2 server using `C2.py`
```
python3 C2.py
```

4: Navigate to `Client` directory and install dependencies on the target VM
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5: Run `Main.py` on the target VM
